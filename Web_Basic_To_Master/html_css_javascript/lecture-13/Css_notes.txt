CSS -> Cascading style sheet
- CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is like the "clothing" for a website. While HTML is the "skeleton" that structures the content (like headings, paragraphs, and images),
CSS is what makes everything look good. It controls how the content is styled—like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
In simple terms, CSS is what makes a plain, boring website beautiful and user-friendly.

CSS depends on four major factors:

1. Selectors – Target specific HTML elements.
2. Properties – Define what to style (e.g., color, size).
3. Values – Specify the settings for properties.
4. Cascade/Specificity – Decide which styles apply when multiple rules conflict.

-> There is three main ways to adds css to a webpage:

1. Inline CSS:
Style is added directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.

ex: <h1 style="color: red;">Hello</h1>

2. Internal CSS:
Styles are written inside a <style> tag within the <head> of the HTML document.

Ex: <style>
  h1 { color: blue; }
</style>

3. External CSS:
A separate CSS file is linked to the HTML using a <link> tag in the <head>.

Ex: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
