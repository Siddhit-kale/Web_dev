-> The CSS display property defines how an element is displayed on the webpage. It controls the layout behavior of the element.

Common Values:

1. block:

The element takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
(e.g., <div>, <p>).

2. inline:

The element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
(e.g., <span>, <a>).

3. inline-block:

Combines inline behavior with block properties like setting width/height.

4. none:

Hides the element; it won’t occupy any space in the layout.

5. flex:

Makes the element a flex container for flexible, responsive layouts.

6. grid:

Turns the element into a grid container for arranging items in rows and columns.

7. inline-flex / inline-grid:

Same as flex/grid, but behaves like an inline element.


-> block element:
    -> div  
        - 1) near line
        - 2) width -> extra left -> extra right
        - 3) custom width and height
        - 4) custom margin and padding

-> Box-sizing -> border-Box

-> inline tages are span and a.

-> difference between inline and block element:

- 1. Block Elements
    Take up the full width: A block element spans the entire width of its parent container.
    Starts on a new line: Automatically breaks to a new line before and after it.
    Supports width and height: You can set the width, height, margin, and padding explicitly.
        Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>–<h6>, <section>

- 2. Inline Elements
    Take up only as much width as needed: An inline element only takes up the space required by its content.
    Does not start on a new line: Inline elements are placed next to each other if there is enough space.
    No width or height support: You cannot directly set width or height; only horizontal padding and margins apply.
        Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>

-> we can convert inline element to block element:
    by using display:block.
