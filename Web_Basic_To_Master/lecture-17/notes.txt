-> What is position property?
-  The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

-> it has five types:

1) static:
Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow.

2) absolute:
The element is position relative to its first positioned ancestor element.

3) fixed:
the element is positioned relative to the browser window.

4) relative:
the element is positioned relative to tis normal position, so "left:20px" adds 
20 pixels to the element's left position.

5) sticky:
The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the 
viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
