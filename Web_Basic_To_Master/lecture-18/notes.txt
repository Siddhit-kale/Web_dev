-> px (Pixels)

    Absolute unit, fixed size.
    Best for precise, unscalable designs.
    Does not respond to screen size changes or user preferences.

-> % (Percentage)

    Relative to the parent element's size.
    Great for responsive layouts, as it scales with the container.

-> vw (Viewport Width)

    1vw = 1% of the viewport's width.
    Useful for dynamic designs based on the browser width.

-> vh (Viewport Height)

    1vh = 1% of the viewport's height.
    Ideal for height-based layouts or full-screen sections.

-> em

    Relative to the font size of the parent element.
    Cascades, so it can compound if nested.

rem (Root em)

    Relative to the font size of the root element (usually <html>).
    More consistent than em as it doesn't compound.
