Data Types in JavaScript
JavaScript has two categories of data types:

Primitive Data Types
Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

1. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are immutable (cannot be changed) and stored by value in memory.

Types of Primitive Data Types:
1. String → Represents textual data.
2. Number → Represents numeric data.
3. Boolean → Represents true or false values.
4. Null → Represents the absence of any object value.
5. Undefined → Represents an uninitialized variable.
6. Symbol → Represents a unique identifier.
7. BigInt → Represents a whole number with a larger range than Number.

2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Non-primitive data types are mutable (can be changed) and stored by reference in memory.

Types of Non-Primitive Data Types:
1. Array → Represents a collection of values.
2. Object → Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
3. Function → Represents a block of code that can be executed.
4. Date → Represents a date and time.
5. RegExp → Represents a regular expression.

What is a Variable?
A variable is a container for storing data in programming. In JavaScript, variables are used to store values like numbers, strings, objects, and more.

Declaring Variables in JavaScript
JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:
1. var (Old, avoid using)
2. let (Modern, recommended)
3. const (For constant values)
